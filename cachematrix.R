## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix:
## Since matrix inversion is a costly computation, the following functions aim to cache 
## the inverse of a matrix rather than repeated computation

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        inv <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                inv <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
        getinverse <- function() inv
        list(set = set,get = get,
             setinverse = setinverse,
             getinverse = getinverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" created by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
## matrix has not changed), then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
## It first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse 
## from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data and 
## sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinverse function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        inv <- x$getinverse()
        if (!is.null(inv)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(inv)
        }
        mat <- x$get()
        inv <- solve(mat, ...)
        x$setinverse(inv)
        inv
}
